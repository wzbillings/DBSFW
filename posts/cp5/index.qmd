## Q1

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

You want to use the beta distribution to determine whether or not a coin you
have is a fair coin — meaning that the coing gives you heads and tails equally.
You flip the coin 10 times and get 4 heads and 6 tails. Using the beta
distribution, what is the probability that the coin will land on heads more than
60 percent of the time?

## Q2

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

You flip the coin 10 more times and now have 9 heads and 11 tails total. What is
the probability that the coin is fair, using our definition of fair, give or
take 5\%?

:::

## Q3

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

Data is the best way to become more confident in your assertions. You flip
the coin 200 more times and end up with 109 heads and 111 tails. Now what is
the probability that the coin is fair, give or take 5\%?

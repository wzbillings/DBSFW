## Q1

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

As mentioned, you mighty disagree with the original probability assigned
to the likelihood:

$$P(\text{broken window, open front door, missing laptop} \mid \text{robbed}) = \frac{3}{10}.$$

**If we change this probability to $3/100$**, how does this change our strength in
believing $H_1$ over $H_2$?

(I bolded the part that was supposed to be in the question but then wasn't.)

## Q2

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

How unlikely would you have to believe being robbed is --- our prior for $H_1$
--- in order for the ratio of $H_1$ to $H_2$ to be one?

## Q1

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

Kansas City, despite its name, sits on the border of two US states:
Missouri and Kansas. The Kansas City metropolitan area consists of 15 counties,
9 in Missouri, and 6 in Kansas. The entire state of Kansas has 105 counties
and Missouri has 114. Use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that
a relative who just moved to a country in the KC metropolitan area also lives
in a county in Kansas. Make sure to show $P(\text{Kansas})$ (assuming your
relative lives in either Kansas or Missouri), $P(\text{Kansas City Metropolitan Area}),$ and $P(\text{Kansas City Metropolitan Area} \mid \text{Kansas})$.

## Q2

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

A deck of cards has 52 cards with suits that are either red or black. There
are four aces in a deck of cards: two red and two black. You remove a red ace
from the deck and shuffle the cards. Your friend pulls a black card. What is
the probability that it is an ace?

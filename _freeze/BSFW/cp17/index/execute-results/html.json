Your friend always picks heads, and\nevery Friday for 10 weeks, the coin lands on heads. You develop a hypothesis\nthat the coin has two heads sides, rather than both a heads side and a tails\nside. Set up a Bayes factor for the hypothesis that the coin is a trick coin\nover the hypothesis that the coin is fair. What does this ratio alone suggest\nabout whether or not your friend is cheating you?\n\n:::\n\nLet $H_1$ be the hypothesis that our friend's coin has heads on both sides\nand let $H_2$ be the hypothesis that our friend's coin is fair. If $H_1$\nwere true, then the probability of every flip being heads would be $1$ no\nmatter how many flips we do. However, under $H_2$, the probability of every\ncoin being heads would be\n$$P(D \\mid H_2) = 0.5^{10} = \\frac{1}{1024}.$$\n\nSo our bayes factor is then\n$$B = \\frac{1}{1 / 1024} = 1024.$$\n\nIf we believed that both scenarios were equally likely, we would have incredibly\nstrong evidence that our friend were cheating.\n\n## Q2\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nNow imagine three cases: that your friend is a bit of a prankster, that your\nfriend is honest most of the time but can occasionally be sneaky, and that your\nfriend is very trustworthy. In each case, estimate some prior odds ratios for\nyour hypothesis and compute the posterior odds.\n\n:::\n\nFor the first case, that our friend is a bit of a prankster, we'll say our\nposterior odds of being tricked are somewhat high, maybe $0.8$ -- that is,\nout of every 5 times we interact with our friend, we expect one prank. The\nposterior odds would then be\n$$0.8 \\times 1024 = 819.2,$$\nand we would still be quite sure that our friend was tricking us.\n\nIf our friend is honest most of the time, say we believe that our prior odds of\nbeing tricked are $1/100$. Then our posterior odds would be\n$$0.01 \\times 1024 = 10.24,$$\nso we should at least be amenable to the idea that our friend is tricking us,\nalthough the evidence is not quite conclusive.\n\nFinally, if our friend is really trustworthy, let's say our prior odds are\n$1/10000$. Then we would get a posterior odds of\n$$0.0001 \\times 1024 = 0.1024,$$\nand we would actually be somewhat confident that our friend is not cheating\n(note that this corresponds to a Bayes factor of about $10$ for the relative\nodds of a fair coin).\n\n## Q3\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nSuppose you trust this friend deeply. Make the prior odds of them cheating\n$1/10000$. How many times would the coin have to land on heads before you feel\nunsure about their innocence--say a posterior odds of 1?\n\n:::\n\nWe need to solve the equation\n$$1 \\leq \\frac{1}{10000}\\frac{1}{0.5^x}$$\nfor $x$, which yields\n$$x \\approx 14.$$\n\nSo we would need to see 14 heads in a row before we would entertain the notion\nthat our friend is cheating.\n\n## Q4\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nAnother friend of yours also hangs out with this same friend and, after only\nfour weeks of the coin landing on heads, feels certain you're both being\ncheated. This confidence implies a posterior odds of about 100. What value would\nyou assign to this other friend's prior belief that the first friend is a\ncheater?\n\n:::\n\nWe can solve for the prior odds in the equation\n$$100 = O(H_1)\\times \\frac{1}{0.5^4},$$\nwhich gives\n$$O(H_1) = 6.25.$$\n\n<!-- END OF FILE -->\n",

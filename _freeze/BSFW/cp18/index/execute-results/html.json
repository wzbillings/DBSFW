What are some factors that might increase your prior belief in your friend's psychic powers?\n\n:::\n\n1. We reality shift to a world where psychic powers exist, because they don't\nin this world.\n1. I go to the gas station with my friend and they buy a single lottery ticket\nfor the exact number that wins the jackpot later that night.\n1. My friend bends a spoon or lifts an object with their mind.\n1. My friend's psychic powers transfer to other dice or cards instead of just\nguessing the result of a six sided die roll.\n\n## Q2\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nAn experiment claims that when people hear the word *Florida* they think of the\nelderly and this has an impact on their walking speed. To test this, we have two\ngroups of 15 students walk across a room: one group hears the word *Florida* and\ndone does not. Assume $H_1 = $ the groups don't move at different speeds and\n$H_2 = $ the Florida group is slower because of hearing the word *Florida*.\n\nThe experiment shows that the Bayes factor for $H_2$ over $H_1$ is 19. Suppose\nsomeone is unconvinced by this epxeriment because $H_2$ had a lower prior odds?\nWhat prior odds would explain someone being unconvinced by this experiment and\nwhat would the BF need to be to bring the posterior odds to 50 for this\nunconvinced person?\n\nNow suppose the prior odds do not change the skeptic's mind. Think of an\nalternate $H_3$ that explains the observation that the Florida group is slower.\nRemember if $H_2$ and $H_3$ both explain the data equally well, only prior odds\nin facor of $H_3$ would lead someone to claim $H_3$ is true over $H_2$, so we\nneed to rethink the experiment so that these odds are decreased. Come up with an\nexperiment that could change the prior odds in $H_3$ over $H_2$.\n\n:::\n\nIf someone were unconvinced by this experiment, we can assume that their\nposterior odds are, say, three or less. Then their prior odds would need to be\n$3/19$ or less. If they are totally unconvinced, say their posterior odds are\n$1$ or less, then the prior odds would need to be $1/19$ or lower to cancel out\nthe Bayes factor entirely. If someone's prior odds were $1/19$, in order for\ntheir posterior odds to be $50$, the bayes factor would need to be\n$19 \\times 50 = 950$. If their prior odds were $3/19$, the bayes factor would\nonly need to be $\\lceil 950 / 3 \\rceil = 317.$\n\nOne alternative hypothesis, which we'll call $H_3$, could be that\nthe two groups of students were measured at different times: the slower group\nwas measured in the morning. We could fix the experiment by ensuring that\nboth groups of students were measured at the same time, or by getting multiple\ngroups of students to repeat the experiments at the same time (adding\nreplicates to our experiment). It could also be possible (say $H_4$) that\nthe slower group just contained all slower students. We could fix this by\nrandomizing students into groups and by replicating the experiment multiple\ntimes. It seems like replicating the experiment might help no matter what.\n\n<!-- END OF FILE -->\n",

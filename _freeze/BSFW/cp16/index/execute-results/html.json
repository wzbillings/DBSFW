The first part,\n$$O(H_1) = \\frac{P(H_1)}{P(H_2)},$$\nis called the *prior odds* even though it's a risk ratio (it is only really\nthe \"odds\" if $H_1$ and $H_2$ are mutually exclusive which is rarely true\nin real life). When we combine the two, we get the posterior odds:\n$$\\tilde{O}(H_1) = O(H_1) \\times B.$$\n\n## Q1\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nReturning to the dice problem, assume that your friend made a mistake and\nsuddenly realized that there were, in fact, two loaded dice and only one\nfair die. How does this change the prior and therefore the posterior\nodds for our problem? Are you more willing to believe that they die being\nrolled is the loaded die?\n\n:::\n\nThe likelihoods of the die rolls are still the same, so we don't need to edit\nthat. However, we need to update our prior possibilities to\n$$P(H_1) = 2/3; \\text{ and } P(H_2) = 1/3,$$\nwhere $H_1$ is the hypothesis that the die is loaded and $H_2$ is the\nhypothesis that the die is fair.\n\nWhen we recompute teh posterior odds, we get\n$$\\frac{2/3}{1/3} \\times 3.77 = 2 \\times 3.77 = 7.54,$$\nso given the data and our prior knowledge, we now believe that the probability\nthat the rolled die was loaded is $7.5 \\times$ higher than the probability that\nthe rolled die was fair.\n\n## Q2\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nReturning to the rare diseases example, suppose you go to the doctor and after\nhaving your ears cleaned you notice that your symptoms persist. Even worse, you\nhave a new symptom: vertigo. The doctor proposes another possible explanation,\nlabyrinthitis, which is a viral infection of the inner ear in which 98 percent of\ncases involve vertigo. However, hearing loss and tinnitus are less common in\nthis disease; hearing loss occurs only 30 percent of the time and tinnitus\noccurs only 28 percent of the time. Vertigo is also a possible symptom of\nvestibular schwannoma, but occurs in only 49 percent of cases. In the general\npopulation, 35 people per million contract labyrinthitis annually. What is the\nposterior odds when you compare the hypothesis that you have labyrinthitis\nagainst the hypothesis that you have vestibular schwannoma?\n\n:::\n\nIf you had vestibular schwannoma ($H_\\text{VS}$), the probability of experiencing\nhearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo would be\n$$P(\\text{symptoms} \\mid \\text{VS}) = 0.94 \\times 0.83 \\times 0.49 = 0.38.$$\n\nIf you had labyrinthitis ($H_\\text{L}$), the probability of experiencing all\nthree symptoms simultaneously would be\n$$P(\\text{symptoms} \\mid \\text{L}) = 0.30 \\times 0.28 \\times 0.98 = 0.08.$$\n\nThe bayes factor for the ratio of labyrinthitis to vestibular schwannoma is then\n$$B_{\\text{L} / \\text{VS}} = \\frac{0.08}{0.38} = 0.21,$$\nindicating that vestibular schwannoma is about 5 times as likely given your\ncurrently symptoms, **if** both diseases were equally likely. Not good!\n\nHowever, if we compute the prior odds of labyrinthitis relative to vestibular\nschwannoma, we get\n$$O(\\text{L}) = \\frac{35/1000000}{11/1000000} = 3.18.$$\n\nThus, the posterior odds of labyrinthitis relative to vestibular schwannoma\nis\n$$3.18 \\times 0.21 = 0.67,$$\nso given our data and the prevalence of both conditions, so unfortunately it\nseems that vestibular schwannoma is a slightly better explanation than\nlabyrinthitis, but the evidence is not extremely strong either way.\n\n<!-- END OF FILE -->\n",

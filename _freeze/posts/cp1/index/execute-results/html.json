Then come up\nwith a hypothesis to explain this data:\n\n> You come home from work and notice that your front door is open and the side\nwindow is broken. As you walk inside, you immediately notice that your laptop\nis missing.\n\n:::\n\nLet $D$ represent the data we've observed. In order words,\n$$D = \\{\\text{door open, window broken, laptop missing}\\}.$$\n\nOur hypothesis might be\n$$H_1: \\text{My house was robbed and they took my laptop!}$$\n\nSo we might conjecture that\n$$P(D \\mid H_1) = \\mathrm{high}.$$\n\n## Q3\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nThe following scenario adds data to the previous one. Demonstrate how this new\ninformation changes your beliefs and come up with a second hypothesis to explain\nthe data, using the notation you've learned in this chapter.\n\n> A neighborhood child runs up to you and apologizes profusely for accidentally\nthrowing a rock through your window. They claim that they saw the laptop and\ndidn't want it stolen so they opened the front door to grab it, and your\nlaptop is safe at their house.\n\n:::\n\nNow we'll let $D_U$ represent our updated data (augmented with the new\ninformation that we learned from this child). Then,\n$$D_U = \\{D, \\text{ child's explanation}\\}$$\n\nand our new hypothesis could be\n$$H_2: \\text{the child has my laptop.}$$\n\nIf the child appears to be telling the truth, we could then conjecture that\n$$P(D_U \\mid H_2) \\gg P(D_U \\mid H_1),$$\nalthough we shouldn't rule out the possibility that the child is being coerced\nor is a part of the robbery.\n\n<!-- end of file -->\n",

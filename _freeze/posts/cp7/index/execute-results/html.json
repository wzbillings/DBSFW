The Kansas City metropolitan area consists of 15 counties,\n9 in Missouri, and 6 in Kansas. The entire state of Kansas has 105 counties\nand Missouri has 114. Use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that\na relative who just moved to a country in the KC metropolitan area also lives\nin a county in Kansas. Make sure to show $P(\\text{Kansas})$ (assuming your\nrelative lives in either Kansas or Missouri), $P(\\text{Kansas City Metropolitan Area}),$ and $P(\\text{Kansas City Metropolitan Area} \\mid \\text{Kansas})$.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Q2\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nA deck of cards has 52 cards with suits that are either red or black. There\nare four aces in a deck of cards: two red and two black. You remove a red ace\nfrom the deck and shuffle the cards. Your friend pulls a black card. What is\nthe probability that it is an ace?\n\n:::\n\n\n\n<!-- end of file -->\n",

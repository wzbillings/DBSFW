(Besides, this event is quite rare, so the\nsimulation will need a lot of samples, as you can see, to converge.)\n\nSince the probability of rolling a 20 on one die is $\\frac{1}{20}$, and the rolls\nare (assumed) independent, we can calculate\n$$P(\\text{three 20's}) = \\left( \\frac{1}{20} \\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8000} = 0.000125.$$\n\n\n## Q2\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nThe weather report says there's a 10 percent chance of rain tomorrow, and you forget your umbrella half the time you go out. What is the probability that you'll be caught in the rain without an umbrella tomorrow?\n\n:::\n\nIf these two events are independent (which is kind of weird but seems to be\nwhat the question wants), we just multiply the two probabilities to get\n\n$$P(\\text{no umbrella} \\cap \\text{rain}) = (10\\%) (50\\%) = 5\\%.$$\n\n## Q3\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nRaw eggs have a $1/20000$ probability of having salmonella. If you eat two raw\neggs, what is the probability you ate a raw egg with salmonella?\n\n:::\n\nWe have to use the inclusion-exclusion rule here to avoid double-counting, since\nthe two eggs having salmonella are not mutually exclusive (they could both\nhave salmonella). So we get\n\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{ate a salmonella egg}) &= P(\\text{egg one had salmonella}) + P(\\text{egg two had salmonella})\n\\\\ &\\quad\\quad -P(\\text{both eggs had salmonella}) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{20000} + \\frac{1}{20000} - \\left(\\frac{1}{20000}\\right) ^2 \\\\\n&= \\frac{39,999}{400,000,000} \\approx 0.009\\%.\n\\end{align*}\n\n## Q4\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple}\n\nWhat is the probability of either flipping two heads in two coin tosses or\nrolling three 6s in three six-sided dice rolls?\n\n:::\n\nI hate how vaguely worded this question is, so I'll list the assumptions that\nI think we are making.\n\nWe are doing one experiment that involves us flipping a coin twice (or flipping\ntwo coins) and also rolling a d6 three times (or rolling 3d6 one time). These\ntwo things are all mutually independent from each other, both coin flips are \nindependent, and all three die rolls are independent. The die rolls and coin\nflips do not affect each other. Once we have done all of these things during\nthe experiment, we want to know the probability that we flipped two heads OR\n(inclusize) we rolled three sixes.\n\nSo, we use inclusion-exclusion again. We get that\n\n$$P(\\text{two heads}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4},$$\n$$P(\\text{three sixes}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{216},$$\nand thus\n$$P(\\text{two heads} \\cup \\text{three sixes}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{216} - \\frac{1}{4 \\cdot 216} = \\frac{219}{864} \\approx 25.35\\%.$$\n\n<!-- end of file -->\n",

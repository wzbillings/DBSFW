Give the beta distribution that describes this. Use integration\nto determine the probability that the true rate of flipping heads is between\n0.4 and 0.6, reflecting the belief that the coin is reasonably fair.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Q2\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nCome up with a prior probability that the coin *is* fair. Use a beta\ndistribution such that there is at least a 95\\% chance that the true rate of\nflipping heads is between 0.4 and 0.6.\n\n:::\n\n\n## Q3\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nNow see how many more heads (with no more tails) it would take to convince you\nthat there is a reasonable chance that this coin is *not* fair. In this case,\nlet's say that this means that our belief in the rate of the coin being between\n0.4 and 0.6 drops below 0.5.\n\n:::\n\nWe have to use the inclusion-exclusion rule here to avoid double-counting, since\nthe two eggs having salmonella are not mutually exclusive (they could both\nhave salmonella). So we get\n\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{ate a salmonella egg}) &= P(\\text{egg one had salmonella}) + P(\\text{egg two had salmonella})\n\\\\ &\\quad\\quad -P(\\text{both eggs had salmonella}) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{20000} + \\frac{1}{20000} - \\left(\\frac{1}{20000}\\right) ^2 \\\\\n&= \\frac{39,999}{400,000,000} \\approx 0.009\\%.\n\\end{align*}\n\n## Q4\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple}\n\nWhat is the probability of either flipping two heads in two coin tosses or\nrolling three 6s in three six-sided dice rolls?\n\n:::\n\nI hate how vaguely worded this question is, so I'll list the assumptions that\nI think we are making.\n\nWe are doing one experiment that involves us flipping a coin twice (or flipping\ntwo coins) and also rolling a d6 three times (or rolling 3d6 one time). These\ntwo things are all mutually independent from each other, both coin flips are \nindependent, and all three die rolls are independent. The die rolls and coin\nflips do not affect each other. Once we have done all of these things during\nthe experiment, we want to know the probability that we flipped two heads OR\n(inclusize) we rolled three sixes.\n\nSo, we use inclusion-exclusion again. We get that\n\n$$P(\\text{two heads}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4},$$\n$$P(\\text{three sixes}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{216},$$\nand thus\n$$P(\\text{two heads} \\cup \\text{three sixes}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{216} - \\frac{1}{4 \\cdot 216} = \\frac{219}{864} \\approx 25.35\\%.$$\n\n<!-- end of file -->\n",

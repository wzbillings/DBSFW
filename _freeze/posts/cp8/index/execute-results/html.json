I personally don't think this chapter\ngeneralizes very well to more complex analyses, but I guess the point of this\nbook is to be beginner-friendly. So maybe I'm at the point on my Bayes journey\nwhere I am confident beyond what I actually know ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯.\n\n# Notes\n\nWe'll return to the missing laptop example. Our goal for this example is\nto calculate the relative posterior probability of our two hypotheses ($H_1:$\nthat we were robbed, and $H_2:$ that the kid has our laptop), that is:\n$$B = \\frac{P(H_1 \\mid D)}{P(H_2 \\mid D)}.$$\n\nNow recall that Bayes' theorem is\n$$P(H_i \\mid D) = \\frac{P(H_i)P(D \\mid H_i)}{P(D)}.$$\nHere, the LHS of the equation is the **posterior probability**. The $P(H_i)$ is\nour **prior probability**, how likely we think the hypothesis is before we\nobserved any data. And we have the $P(D \\mid H_i)$ part, which the book calls\nthe **likelihood**. I grew up frequentist and pedantic so I typically always\ncall this the ***sample*** **likelihood** or *the likelihood of the sample*.\nNot sure why but I almost always use the latter, I think it just sounds nice.\n\nNow, here are the probabilities the chapter gives us for the things we will\nneed to calculate the relative posterior probability (which the book calls\nthe relative likelihood, but I am strongly of the belief that likelihood\nis a technical term and the posterior probabilities are not likelihoods).\n\n\\begin{align*}\nP(H_1) &= \\frac{1}{1000} \\\\\nP(D \\mid H_1) &= \\frac{3}{10}  \\\\\nP(H_2) &= \\frac{1}{21,900,000}   \\\\\nP(D \\mid H_2) &= 1 \n\\end{align*}\n\nSo with this information we can calculate the relative posterior probability (\nnote that we can calculate the relative posterior probabilities but not the\nindividual posterior probabilities because the normalizing factors are unknown\nto us) to get\n$$B = \\frac{3 / 10000}{1 / 21,900,000} = 6750. $$\nSo, given our data, it is 6750 times more likely that we were robbed.\n\n## Q1\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nAs mentioned, you mighty disagree with the original probability assigned\nto the likelihood:\n\n$$P(\\text{broken window, open front door, missing laptop} \\mid \\text{robbed}) = \\frac{3}{10}.$$\n\n**If we change this probability to $1/100$**, how does this change our strength in\nbelieving $H_1$ over $H_2$?\n\n:::\n\n(I bolded the part that was supposed to be in the question but then wasn't.) If\nwe do this, it only changes the numerator of our ratio and we get that\n$$B = \\frac{3 / 100000}{1 / 21,900,000} = 675. $$\nSo this decreases our ratio by a factor of 10, the same amount that our beliefs\nchanged.\n\n## Q2\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nHow unlikely would you have to believe being robbed is --- our prior for $H_1$\n--- in order for the ratio of $H_1$ to $H_2$ to be one?\n\n:::\n\nCall our unknown prior probability $p$. Then we solve:\n$$\\frac{p \\ \\frac{3}{100}}{1 / 21,900,000} \\implies p = \\frac{1}{65,700}.$$\nOur prior probability would need to decrease by a factor of 657.\n\n\n<!-- end of file -->\n",

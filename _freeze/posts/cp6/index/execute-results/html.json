I didn't take\na lot of notes here, but I did at least write down what is covered in this\nsection. For a more detailed explanation of conditional probability, I recommend\neither\n[Probability for the Enthusiastic Beginner by Morin](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=+978-1523318674+&new_used=*&destination=us&currency=USD&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr)\nor\n[Mathematical Statistics with Applications by Wackerly et al.](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?keywords=+978-0495110811+&currency=USD&destination=us&mode=basic&classic=off&lang=en&st=sh&ac=qr&submit=).\n(I make no money from these\nlinks, sales, or promotions.)\n\n# Notes\n\n* **Conditional probabilities** are used when the occurence of event $A$ is\nnot independent from the occurence of event $B$ -- if we know the outcome of\nevent $B$, our belief in the chance that $A$ will occur changes.\n* We denote this as $P(A \\mid B)$, which is read \"the probability of event $A$,\ngiven event $B$\". This is defined as\n\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}.$$\n\n* The product rule we learned before only works for independent events, so for\ndependent events, we have to use this definition to get a slightly different\nrule.\n\n$$P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B \\mid A) = P(B) \\cdot P(A \\mid B).$$\n* Note the equivalency we see above. We can use this to derive **Bayes'\ntheorem** as well. This is a rule (not really a \"theorem\") that allows us to\n\"flip\" a conditional probability.\n\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A) \\ P(B \\mid A)}{P(B)} =\n\\frac{P(A) \\ P(B \\mid A)}{P(A) \\ P(B \\mid A) + P(\\lnot A)P(B \\mid \\lnot A)}.$$\n\nThe book doesn't include the last equivalency in this section but I'm not sure\nwhy because this is where it has been in every other conditional probability\nlecture I've had and it's often quite useful.\n\n* The book says that the interesting thing to notice about this relationship\nis that we have the power to relate $P(\\text{observed} \\mid \\text{belief})$\nto $P(\\text{belief} \\mid \\text{observed}).$\n\n# Solutions\n\n## Q1\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nWhat piece of information would we need in order to use Bayes' theorem to\ndetermine the probability that someone in 2010 who had GBS *also* had the\nflu vaccine that year?\n\n:::\n\nThis is another question that I have beef with. I think it is reasonable\nwould interpret \"the probability that someone in 2010 who had GBS also had the\nflu vaccine that year\" as $P(\\text{GBS} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}).$ But the book\nwants us to read this as $P(\\text{flu vaccine} \\mid \\text{GBS}),$ which I would\ntend to word as (unambiguously) \"the probability that someone in 2010 received\nthe flu vaccine, given that they had GBS.\" Since conditional/joint probabilities\nare often vague like this, I think it is best to be specific instead of just\nmaking the word *also* italicized.\n\nBut anyways. The formula for this calculation is\n$$P(\\text{flu vaccine} \\mid \\text{GBS}) = \\frac{P(\\text{flu vaccine}) \\\nP(\\text{GBS} \\mid \\text{flu vaccine})}{P(\\text{GBS})},$$\nso the main thing we are missing is $P(\\text{GBS})$, which would allow us to\ncalculate $P(\\text{GBS} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine})$, the only other part we were\nnot given in the chapter.\n\n## Q2\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nWhat is the probability that a random person picked from the population\nis female and is *not* color blind?\n\n:::\n\nMost of the details for this problem are given in the chapter. Note that for\nthis example, the book is talking about the *joint* probability, despite what\nI think is very similar wording to the previous question, but maybe I need to\nwork on my reading comprehension. Anyways, the relevant formula would be\n\n$$P(\\text{female} \\cap \\lnot \\text{color blind}) = P(\\text{female}) \\ P(\\lnot\n\\text{color blind} \\mid \\text{female}).$$\n\nAssuming male individuals and female individuals are equally likely in the\npopulation and are the only two options (**neither of which is true**, but\nthey are both assumed to be true by the book for this question), we have\nall of the information that we need to solve this. We get\n\n$$P(\\text{female} \\cap \\lnot \\text{color blind}) = (0.5)(1 - 0.005) = 0.4975.$$\nSo the probability is $49.75\\%,$ since the incidence of color blindness among\nfemale members of the population is extremely low.\n\n## Q3\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nWhat is the probability that a male who received the flu vaccine in 2010 is\neither color blind or has GBS?\n\n:::\n\nI'll steal from the notation that the book uses here, and let\n$A$ be the event that this individual is colorblind, given that they are male,\nand let $B$ be the event that this individual has GBS, given that they got\nthe flu vaccine. Note that this makes several independence assumptions (being\nmale or color blind are both independent of the flu vaccine and GBS, and vice\nversa), because if we don't make this independence assumptions we would lack\nthe necessary information to solve this problem.\n\nNow, the probability we want to find is\n$$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) P(B \\mid A).$$\n\nIn the chapter, we previously learned the values for $P(A)$ and $P(B)$, but\nI think this is where the problem starts to break down. The chapter hasn't\ndealt with any really complicated events like this at all, and it doesn't\nreally make sense to say that\n$$P(B \\mid A) = P( (\\text{GBS} \\mid \\text{flu vaccine}) \\mid (\\text{color \nblind} \\mid \\text{male}) ).$$\n\nSo of course the book does not discuss how to address this problem, as it\nreally isn't very well-formed, it just says to assume $P(B \\mid A) = P(B).$\nThis is true **if** we make all of the independence assumptions above, but\nagain, stating the problem in this way doesn't really make sense.\n\nSo, I'll detour and work through the problem in a way that I think is a bit\nmore logical and arrives at the same answer.\n\nWhen I read the question, the probability that I think we want to get is\n$$P(\\text{color blind} \\cup \\text{GBS} \\mid \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}).$$\nThis is much more complex than any of the examples in the book, but fortunately\nfor us, we can work it out using the laws of set theory that the book has not\ndiscussed at all. Note that, by definition of conditional probability,\n\n$$\nP(\\text{color blind} \\cup \\text{GBS} \\mid \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine})\n= \\frac{P\\left[(\\text{color blind} \\cup \\text{GBS}) \\cap (\\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) \\right]}{P(\\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine})}.\n$$\nNow, the denominator is pretty easy to sort out. Since we don't have any\ninformation on how being male affects flu vaccine coverage, we'll assume they\nare independent (although in real life, this is not true -- CDC flu vaccine\ncoverage data for the USA suggests that males under 65 are less likely to\nget flu vaccines than females of the same age, but this different goes away for\nthe elderly). Under this assumption, we get\n$$P(\\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) = P(\\text{male}) \\ P(\\text{flu\nvaccine}),$$\nwhich is easy enough to calculate with the data we have.\n\nSo it remains to deal with the beast of a numerator. For ease-of-use here,\nlet's define the event $C \\equiv \\text{color blind} \\cup \\text{GBS}$ and the\nevent $D \\equiv \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}.$ Then, we get that\n\n$$\nP(C \\cap D) = \\left(\\text{color blind} \\cup \\text{GBS}\\right) \\cap D =\n(\\text{color blind} \\cap D) \\cup (\\text{GBS} \\cap D)\n$$\nby using the distributive rules of the $cap$ and $cup$ operators. These are not\ncovered in the book, but one potential resource (in terms of set theory)\nis [here](https://math.libretexts.org/Courses/Monroe_Community_College/MTH_220_Discrete_Math/4%3A_Sets/4.3%3A_Unions_and_Intersections).\nMany books on probability will also briefly cover this material.\n\nNow, we have a union, and we can use the addition (or inclusion-exclusion)\nprinciple to evaluate the probability. We get that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nP((\\text{color blind} \\cap D) \\cup (\\text{GBS} \\cap D)) &=\nP(\\text{color blind} \\cap D) + P(\\text{GBS} \\cap D) - P(\\text{color blind}\n\\cap \\text{GBS} \\cap D) \\\\\n&=  P(\\text{color blind} \\cap \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) + P(\\text{GBS} \\cap \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) \\\\ &\\quad \\quad - P(\\text{color blind}\n\\cap \\text{GBS} \\cap (\\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine})).\n\\end{align*}\n\nUnder the same set of independence assumptions before, we can make the\nfollowing set of simplifications:\n\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{color blind} \\cap \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) &=\n\tP(\\text{color blind} \\cap \\text{male}) \\ P(\\text{flu vaccine}) \\\\\nP(\\text{GBS} \\cap \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) &=\n\tP(\\text{GBS} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) \\ P(\\text{male}) \\\\\nP(\\text{color blind} \\cap \\text{GBS} \\cap\n\t(\\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine})) &= \n\tP(\\text{GBS} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine} \\cap \\text{male} \\cap\n\t\\text{color blind}) \\\\\n\t&= P(\\text{male} \\cap \\text{color blind}) \\ P(\\text{GBS} \\cap\n\t\\text{flu vaccine}).\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, it would be just about impossible to write all that out in text format\nand still have it fit into the margins of this page. But nonethless we will\ntry. We get that, overall,\n\n::: {.smaller}\n\n\\begin{equation*}P(\\text{color blind} \\cup \\text{GBS} \\mid \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) =\n\\frac{\n\\left(\\begin{split}\n\t&P(\\text{color blind} \\cap \\text{male}) \\ P(\\text{flu vaccine}) \\\\\n\t&\\quad + P(\\text{GBS} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) \\ P(\\text{male}) \\\\\n\t&\\quad - P(\\text{male} \\cap \\text{color blind}) \\ P(\\text{GBS} \\cap\n\t\\text{flu vaccine})\n\\end{split}\\right)\n}{\nP(\\text{male}) \\ P(\\text{flu\nvaccine})\n}.\n\\end{equation*}\n\n:::\n\nI can't figure out how to make the text of that smaller in this quarto HTML\ndocument and it's too much work to figure out how to size the LaTeX code in a\nway that's supported by MathJax so that's the best that you're getting from me.\n\nAnyways, if we want to solve this with the information given in the book,\nwe have to get rid of all of the $P(\\text{flu vaccine})$, since we don't\nknow that. Fortunately for us, they cancel out. First, let's plug in the\nnumbers that we do know so this is a bit less cumbersome to type. Let\n\n$$\\mathrm{P} = P(\\text{color blind} \\cup \\text{GBS} \\mid \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine})$$\n\nfor convenience (should've said this earlier but it's too late now). We get\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{P} & =\n\\frac{\n\\left(\\begin{split}\n\t&P(\\text{color blind} \\cap \\text{male}) \\ P(\\text{flu vaccine}) \\\\\n\t&\\quad + P(\\text{GBS} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) \\ P(\\text{male}) \\\\\n\t&\\quad - P(\\text{male} \\cap \\text{color blind}) \\ P(\\text{GBS} \\cap\n\t\\text{flu vaccine})\n\\end{split}\\right)\n}{\nP(\\text{male}) \\ P(\\text{flu\nvaccine})\n} \\\\ \\\\ &= \\frac{\n0.04 \\ P(\\text{FV}) + 0.5 \\ P(\\text{GBS} \\mid \\text{FV}) \\ P(\\text{FV}) -\n\t0.04 \\ P(\\text{GBS} \\mid \\text{FV}) \\ P(\\text{FV})\n}{\n0.5 \\ P(\\text{FV})\n} \\\\ &=\n\\frac{P(\\text{FV})\\left( 0.04 + 0.46 \\ P(\\text{GBS} \\mid \\text{FV}) \\right)}{\n0.5 \\ P(\\text{FV})\n} \\\\\n&= \\frac{0.04 + 0.46 (3 / 100,000)}{0.5} \\\\\n&= 0.0800276 = 8.00276\\%.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThis is the same answer that the book has, so their shortcut that I don't\nlike apparently works (and saves a lot of time). But I had a good time\nproving that it was true without shortcuts, so I guess it was worth it.\n\nWell, that's all for this chapter!\n\n<!-- end of file -->\n",

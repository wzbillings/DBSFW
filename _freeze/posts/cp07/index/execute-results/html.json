Mostly because this chapter is super short. Just for good\nmeasure, I'll do the mathematician thing and say. Recall Bayes' Theorem:\n\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}.$$\n\n## Q1\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nKansas City, despite its name, sits on the border of two US states:\nMissouri and Kansas. The Kansas City metropolitan area consists of 15 counties,\n9 in Missouri, and 6 in Kansas. The entire state of Kansas has 105 counties\nand Missouri has 114. Use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that\na relative who just moved to a country in the KC metropolitan area also lives\nin a county in Kansas. Make sure to show $P(\\text{Kansas})$ (assuming your\nrelative lives in either Kansas or Missouri), $P(\\text{Kansas City Metropolitan Area}),$ and $P(\\text{Kansas City Metropolitan Area} \\mid \\text{Kansas})$.\n\n:::\n\nAssuming that our relative is equally likely to have moved to any of the\ncounties in the KC metropolitan area is an interesting choice, but is necessary\nfor doing this problem. So we'll assume that. Now, assuming that our relative\nhas moved to either Kansas or Missouri, the overall probability that they\nare in Kansas is\n$$P(\\text{Kansas}) = \\frac{105}{105 + 114} = \\frac{105}{219}.$$\nThe probability that our relative lives in Kansas City, assuming they live in\neither Kansas or Missouri (and again, that all counties are equally likely) is\n$$P(\\text{KC}) = \\frac{15}{219}.$$\nThe probability that our relative lives in Kansas City, if we already knew that\nthey lived in Kansas, is\n$$P(\\text{KC} \\mid \\text{Kansas}) = \\frac{6/219}{105/219}=\\frac{6}{105}.$$\nThen, by Bayes' Theorem, we get that the probability that our relative lives\nin Kansas, given that they live in Kansas City, is\n$$P(\\text{Kansas} \\mid \\text{KC}) = \\frac{P(\\text{KC} \\mid \\text{Kansas})\n\\ P(\\text{Kansas})}{P(\\text{KC})} = \\frac{\\frac{6}{105} \\frac{105}{219}}{\n\\frac{15}{219}} = \\frac{6/219}{15/219} = \\frac{6}{15} = 40\\%.$$\n\n## Q2\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nA deck of cards has 52 cards with suits that are either red or black. There\nare four aces in a deck of cards: two red and two black. You remove a red ace\nfrom the deck and shuffle the cards. Your friend pulls a black card. What is\nthe probability that it is an ace?\n\n:::\n\nI like this problem more because it's like orbs in an urn. We don't have to\nmake any other assumptions, this is just good normal probabilities. Anyways.\n\nThe probability that our friend draws an ace from the remaining 51 cards is\n$$P(\\text{ace}) = \\frac{3}{51}.$$\n(I am deliberately chosing not to reduce this fraction, because I don't have to\nand because the solution is easier to understand if the fractions aren't\nreduced.) The probability that our friend draws a black card from the\nremaining 51 cards (26 of which are black and 25 of which are red) is\n$$P(\\text{black}) = \\frac{26}{51}.$$\nNow, if our friend draws an ace, the probability that it is black (given\nthat we know it is an ace already) is\n$$P(\\text{black} \\mid \\text{ace}) = \\frac{P(\\text{black and ace})}{\nP(\\text{ace})} = \\frac{2 / 51}{3 / 51} = \\frac{2}{3}.$$\nNow we can use Bayes' theorem to get that\n$$P(\\text{ace} \\mid \\text{black}) = \\frac{P(\\text{black} \\mid \\text{ace})\nP(\\text{black})}{P(\\text{ace})} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3} \\ \\frac{3}{51}}{\n\\frac{26}{51}} = \\frac{2 / 51}{26 / 51} = \\frac{2}{26} = \\frac{1}{13}.$$\nSince all the black cards are still in the deck, once we know that our friend\nhas drawn a black card, the probability that is an ace is the same as if they\nhad drawn from the full deck (if we hadn't removed a card). How neat!\n\n<!-- end of file -->\n",

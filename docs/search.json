If you have a 1/5 probability of receiving a job offer when you interview, and you interview with seven companies in a month, what is the probability you‚Äôll have at least two competing offers by the end of that month.\n\n\n\nThis time we have to consider more than just one of these probabilities, because we want the probability of at least two offers. Let \\(O\\) be the number of competing offers we receive. Then we can write \\[P(O \\geq 2) = B\\left(O = 2 \\mid n = 7, p = \\frac{1}{5}\\right) + \\ldots + B\\left(O = 7 \\mid n = 7, p = \\frac{1}{5}\\right),\\] which we could also write more compactly as \\[P(O \\geq 2) = \\sum_{o = 2}^7 B\\left(O = o \\mid n = 7, p = \\frac{1}{5}\\right).\\] Since dbinom() is vectorized, we can calculate this pretty easily in R.\n\nsum( dbinom(x = 2:7, size = 7, prob = 1 / 5) )\n\n[1] 0.4233\n\n\nOf course, as you might have guessed, R has a shortcut for this: the pbinom function. This way is a little bit tricky though, because the way we have to specify the probability we want is a little more complicated than we would hope.\nThe lower.tail parameter specifies whether we want the cumulative probability above (FALSE) or below (TRUE) the argument(s) for the q parameter. For above, the probability is \\(P(X > x)\\), but for below, it is \\(P(X \\leq x)\\). Since we have a positive probability at \\(P(X = x)\\), we can‚Äôt just throw in 2 as the boundary, it will not give the correct answer. Instead we can use this function to calculate \\[P(X \\geq 2) = 1 - P(X < 2) = 1 - P(X \\leq 1) = P(X > 1).\\] This last two forms are the two that we can get with pbinom, as I‚Äôll calculate below.\n\n# P(O > 1)\npbinom(q = 1, size = 7, prob =  1 / 5, lower.tail = FALSE)\n\n[1] 0.4233\n\n# 1 - P(O <= 1)\n1 - pbinom(q = 1, size = 7, prob = 1 / 5)\n\n[1] 0.4233\n\n\nOf course all three of these solutions are equivalent, so no matter which way we do it, we get a probability of about \\(42\\%\\)."

If you have a 1/5 probability of receiving a job offer when you interview, and you interview with seven companies in a month, what is the probability you‚Äôll have at least two competing offers by the end of that month.\n\n\n\nThis time we have to consider more than just one of these probabilities, because we want the probability of at least two offers. Let \\(O\\) be the number of competing offers we receive. Then we can write \\[P(O \\geq 2) = B\\left(O = 2 \\mid n = 7, p = \\frac{1}{5}\\right) + \\ldots + B\\left(O = 7 \\mid n = 7, p = \\frac{1}{5}\\right),\\] which we could also write more compactly as \\[P(O \\geq 2) = \\sum_{o = 2}^7 B\\left(O = o \\mid n = 7, p = \\frac{1}{5}\\right).\\] Since dbinom() is vectorized, we can calculate this pretty easily in R.\n\nsum( dbinom(x = 2:7, size = 7, prob = 1 / 5) )\n\n[1] 0.4233\n\n\nOf course, as you might have guessed, R has a shortcut for this: the pbinom function. This way is a little bit tricky though, because the way we have to specify the probability we want is a little more complicated than we would hope.\nThe lower.tail parameter specifies whether we want the cumulative probability above (FALSE) or below (TRUE) the argument(s) for the q parameter. For above, the probability is \\(P(X > x)\\), but for below, it is \\(P(X \\leq x)\\). Since we have a positive probability at \\(P(X = x)\\), we can‚Äôt just throw in 2 as the boundary, it will not give the correct answer. Instead we can use this function to calculate \\[P(X \\geq 2) = 1 - P(X < 2) = 1 - P(X \\leq 1) = P(X > 1).\\] This last two forms are the two that we can get with pbinom, as I‚Äôll calculate below.\n\n# P(O > 1)\npbinom(q = 1, size = 7, prob =  1 / 5, lower.tail = FALSE)\n\n[1] 0.4233\n\n# 1 - P(O <= 1)\n1 - pbinom(q = 1, size = 7, prob = 1 / 5)\n\n[1] 0.4233\n\n\nOf course all three of these solutions are equivalent, so no matter which way we do it, we get a probability of about \\(42\\%\\)."

The chapter hasn‚Äôt dealt with any really complicated events like this at all, and it doesn‚Äôt really make sense to say that \\[P(B \\mid A) = P( (\\text{GBS} \\mid \\text{flu vaccine}) \\mid (\\text{color\nblind} \\mid \\text{male}) ).\\]\nSo of course the book does not discuss how to address this problem, as it really isn‚Äôt very well-formed, it just says to assume \\(P(B \\mid A) = P(B).\\) This is true if we make all of the independence assumptions above, but again, stating the problem in this way doesn‚Äôt really make sense.\nSo, I‚Äôll detour and work through the problem in a way that I think is a bit more logical and arrives at the same answer.\nWhen I read the question, the probability that I think we want to get is \\[P(\\text{color blind} \\cup \\text{GBS} \\mid \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}).\\] This is much more complex than any of the examples in the book, but fortunately for us, we can work it out using the laws of set theory that the book has not discussed at all. Note that, by definition of conditional probability,\n\\[\nP(\\text{color blind} \\cup \\text{GBS} \\mid \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine})\n= \\frac{P\\left[(\\text{color blind} \\cup \\text{GBS}) \\cap (\\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) \\right]}{P(\\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine})}.\n\\] Now, the denominator is pretty easy to sort out. Since we don‚Äôt have any information on how being male affects flu vaccine coverage, we‚Äôll assume they are independent (although in real life, this is not true ‚Äì CDC flu vaccine coverage data for the USA suggests that males under 65 are less likely to get flu vaccines than females of the same age, but this different goes away for the elderly). Under this assumption, we get \\[P(\\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) = P(\\text{male}) \\ P(\\text{flu\nvaccine}),\\] which is easy enough to calculate with the data we have.\nSo it remains to deal with the beast of a numerator. For ease-of-use here, let‚Äôs define the event \\(C \\equiv \\text{color blind} \\cup \\text{GBS}\\) and the event \\(D \\equiv \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}.\\) Then, we get that\n\\[\nP(C \\cap D) = \\left(\\text{color blind} \\cup \\text{GBS}\\right) \\cap D =\n(\\text{color blind} \\cap D) \\cup (\\text{GBS} \\cap D)\n\\] by using the distributive rules of the \\(cap\\) and \\(cup\\) operators. These are not covered in the book, but one potential resource (in terms of set theory) is here. Many books on probability will also briefly cover this material.\nNow, we have a union, and we can use the addition (or inclusion-exclusion) principle to evaluate the probability. We get that\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nP((\\text{color blind} \\cap D) \\cup (\\text{GBS} \\cap D)) &=\nP(\\text{color blind} \\cap D) + P(\\text{GBS} \\cap D) - P(\\text{color blind}\n\\cap \\text{GBS} \\cap D) \\\\\n&=  P(\\text{color blind} \\cap \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) + P(\\text{GBS} \\cap \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) \\\\ &\\quad \\quad - P(\\text{color blind}\n\\cap \\text{GBS} \\cap (\\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine})).\n\\end{align*}\\]\nUnder the same set of independence assumptions before, we can make the following set of simplifications: \\[\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{color blind} \\cap \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) &=\n    P(\\text{color blind} \\cap \\text{male}) \\ P(\\text{flu vaccine}) \\\\\nP(\\text{GBS} \\cap \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) &=\n    P(\\text{GBS} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) \\ P(\\text{male}) \\\\\nP(\\text{color blind} \\cap \\text{GBS} \\cap\n    (\\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine})) &=\n    P(\\text{GBS} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine} \\cap \\text{male} \\cap\n    \\text{color blind}) \\\\\n    &= P(\\text{male} \\cap \\text{color blind}) \\ P(\\text{GBS} \\cap\n    \\text{flu vaccine}).\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNow, it would be just about impossible to write all that out in text format and still have it fit into the margins of this page. But nonethless we will try. We get that, overall,\n\n\\[\\begin{equation*}P(\\text{color blind} \\cup \\text{GBS} \\mid \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) =\n\\frac{\n\\left(\\begin{split}\n    &P(\\text{color blind} \\cap \\text{male}) \\ P(\\text{flu vaccine}) \\\\\n    &\\quad + P(\\text{GBS} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) \\ P(\\text{male}) \\\\\n    &\\quad - P(\\text{male} \\cap \\text{color blind}) \\ P(\\text{GBS} \\cap\n    \\text{flu vaccine})\n\\end{split}\\right)\n}{\nP(\\text{male}) \\ P(\\text{flu\nvaccine})\n}.\n\\end{equation*}\\]\n\nI can‚Äôt figure out how to make the text of that smaller in this quarto HTML document and it‚Äôs too much work to figure out how to size the LaTeX code in a way that‚Äôs supported by MathJax so that‚Äôs the best that you‚Äôre getting from me.\nAnyways, if we want to solve this with the information given in the book, we have to get rid of all of the \\(P(\\text{flu vaccine})\\), since we don‚Äôt know that. Fortunately for us, they cancel out. First, let‚Äôs plug in the numbers that we do know so this is a bit less cumbersome to type. Let\n\\[\\mathrm{P} = P(\\text{color blind} \\cup \\text{GBS} \\mid \\text{male} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine})\\]\nfor convenience (should‚Äôve said this earlier but it‚Äôs too late now). We get \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{P} & =\n\\frac{\n\\left(\\begin{split}\n    &P(\\text{color blind} \\cap \\text{male}) \\ P(\\text{flu vaccine}) \\\\\n    &\\quad + P(\\text{GBS} \\cap \\text{flu vaccine}) \\ P(\\text{male}) \\\\\n    &\\quad - P(\\text{male} \\cap \\text{color blind}) \\ P(\\text{GBS} \\cap\n    \\text{flu vaccine})\n\\end{split}\\right)\n}{\nP(\\text{male}) \\ P(\\text{flu\nvaccine})\n} \\\\ \\\\ &= \\frac{\n0.04 \\ P(\\text{FV}) + 0.5 \\ P(\\text{GBS} \\mid \\text{FV}) \\ P(\\text{FV}) -\n    0.04 \\ P(\\text{GBS} \\mid \\text{FV}) \\ P(\\text{FV})\n}{\n0.5 \\ P(\\text{FV})\n} \\\\ &=\n\\frac{P(\\text{FV})\\left( 0.04 + 0.46 \\ P(\\text{GBS} \\mid \\text{FV}) \\right)}{\n0.5 \\ P(\\text{FV})\n} \\\\\n&= \\frac{0.04 + 0.46 (3 / 100,000)}{0.5} \\\\\n&= 0.0800276 = 8.00276\\%.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis is the same answer that the book has, so their shortcut that I don‚Äôt like apparently works (and saves a lot of time). But I had a good time proving that it was true without shortcuts, so I guess it was worth it.\nWell, that‚Äôs all for this chapter!"

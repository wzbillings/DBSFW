# Bookwork: Exercises and Solutions

This website contains my notes, solutions, etc. for a few textbooks I've read.
I'm partially trying to document my learning and thinking process for myself so
I can come back to it later if I need to, but also partially trying to write the
solutions in an expository style so they can be understood by other people who
happen to read this.

## Current books

*  **Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way** by [Will Kurt](https://www.countbayesie.com/about).

## Bug and typo reports

[GH Issues](https://github.com/wzbillings/bookwork/issues) for questions or typos
or comments or things that I said that are incorrect are welcome!

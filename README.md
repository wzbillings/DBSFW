# DBSFW Solutions

I'm reading **Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way** by [Will Kurt](https://www.countbayesie.com/about).
For like three months I thought the name of the book had "Doing" at the front which is why the repo
is named that. Maybe I'll get around to fixing the repo name and website header eventually.

This is the quarto website where I post my notes, solutions, thoughts, etc. Partially trying to document
my learning and thinking process for myself so I can come back to it later if I need to, but also partially
trying to write the solutions in an expository style so they can be understood by other people
who happen to read this.

[GH Issues](https://github.com/wzbillings/DBSFW/issues) for questions or typos or comments or things that
I said that are incorrect are welcome!
